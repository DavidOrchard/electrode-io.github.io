###You Ask, We Answer:

#### 1. What are archetypes?

Electrode archetypes are a way for every electrode module to share common scripts, dependencies and best practices that can be updated in real time, and have that update propagate to every module that inherits from that specific archetype.

<br>
Please refer to [what are archetypes?](what_are_archetypes.html) for a detailed description of archetypes.

#### 2. Why is my server throwing error "cannot find module ..." on start up?

Most likely you are using npm@2. Upgrade to npm@3 by running command `npm i -g npm@3` and redo `npm i`.

#### 3. What is the difference between creating a new electrode app using yo electrode vs cloning/forking Electrode Boilerplate?

[Electrode Boilerplate] was created using `yo electrode` command. `yo electrode` gives you a bare bones Electrode Isomorphic Universal React App with NodeJS backend.

[Electrode Boilerplate] includes all the bells and whistles for the SSR optimizations using the
following modules configured and integrated for your use:

* [Electrode Confippet]
* [Electrode CSRF JWT]
* [Electrode React SSR Caching]
* [Electrode Redux Router Engine]
* [Above The Fold Only Server Render]

Refer to this amazing [blog entry](https://medium.com/walmartlabs/using-electrode-to-improve-react-server-side-render-performance-by-up-to-70-e43f9494eb8b#.9qjftiinq) about How Electrode improved Server Render performance by 70% using the [stand alone modules](stand_alone_modules.html) listed above.
